    CLI-Mate is a simple weather fetching application written in python.

    CLI-Mate uses an OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. To use this app
    you must create a profile at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up.
    Once your account is created there will be an API Key sent to your email,
    which is also viewable in your profile at OpenWeatherMap.org under the 
    'API Keys'tab.

    Running CLI-Mate for the first time will automatically take you to Settings.
    Here you are greeted by a simple menu which allows you to enter you API key
    or your zipcode. This information can be changed any time.

    Once this information is entered you are ready to quickly get weather data 
    from anywhere in the United States.
